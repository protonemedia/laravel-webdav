'providers' => [
    ...
    Pbmedia\FilesystemProviders\WebDAVServiceProvider::class
    ...
];
```

Create a webdav filesystem disk:

``` php
// config/filesystems.php

'disks' => [
	...
	'webdav' => [
	    'driver'     => 'webdav',
	    'baseUri'    => 'https://mywebdavstorage.com',
	    'userName'   => 'protonemedia',
	    'password'   => 'supersecretpassword',
	    'pathPrefix' => 'backups', // optional
	],
	...
];
```
### Authentication
